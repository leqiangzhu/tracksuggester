		<div id="suggestionOfJava">
		  <p>We recommend that you learn Java.</p></br>
			<p>Java is also a favorite of enterprise companies, but its appeal is broader as well:
			it's one of the most popular of all programming languages, and it's used in everything
			from for high-performance processing to building Android user interfaces. Because Java 
			has been very popular for a very long time and is used in so many applications, 
			it is also a very high-demand language. If you're interested in working for an 
			enterprise-level company, as an Android developer, 
			or in high-performance applications, Java could be a good language to learn.</p>
		</div>
		<div id="suggestionOfCsharp">
		  <p>We recommend that you learn C&#35</p></br>
			<P>C# is most popular among bigger established businesses, often for building internal software. 
			Because it's been around for a long time and has the backing of Microsoft, it is one of the 
			most in-demand languages in the job market. C# has also been going through a bit of a rebirth 
			lately, with Microsoft open sourcing the language and surrounding platform, porting it to run 
			on Mac and Linux, and incorporating many of the best features of other languages. 
			If you like the idea of working for a larger company on business software, C# is a great choice.</P>
		</div>
		<div  id="suggestionOfCss">
		  <p>We recommend that you start learning from CSS & HTML.</p></br>
		  
		  <p>People often begin by learning HTML and CSS.  
		  These two languages are essential for creating static web pages. 
		  HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) structures all the text, links, 
		  and other content you see on a website. CSS is the language that 
		  makes a web page look the way it does—color, layout, and other the visuals we call style.</p></br>

			<p>Why not just start with HTML and CSS? You may not be interested 
			in creating content for the Web. As I said earlier, 
			you can do a lot with code, and the Web is just part of it. 
			However, if you are interested making websites, 
			definitely start with HTML and CSS.</p>
